Coursera: Getting and Cleaning Data

### Introduction:  

This code book lists the columns in the final tidy data set produced by the run_analysis.R script in this repo.

The original data set had 561 features listed. Out of these, I have selected all the features which had mean() or std() in them.
This gave me a total of 79 features. However, I am not going to concider the columns which have meanFreq() in them since i think
 these are frequencies rather than mean values by themselves. There are 13 such variables. So after removing these columns, I have the 
 list of my final 66 features in the input data set.
 
 
 Also, after combining the test and training data set, I have grouped the final tidy data by Subject and Activity and then taken the Mean of each row.
 
 **As such, each cell value represents the Mean value of the feature for that subject and activity.**
 
 
### Feature Names Cleanup:

I have applied the following transformations to make my feature names tidy:

* removed hyphens "-"
* removed brackets "()"              
* removing repeated word "Body"
* expanded short form "Acc" to "Acceleration" to make it more readable 
* expanded short form "Gyro" to "AngularVelocity" to make it more meaningful
* expanded short form "Mag" to "Magnitude" to make it more readable          
* Converted variable names to uniform case where initial letters of words are capitalized
* Expanded the 'X' at the end to 'Xaxis' to make it more readable and identify that we are referring to the orientation.
* Expanded the 'Y' at the end to 'Yaxis' to make it more readable and identify that we are referring to the orientation.
* Expanded the 'Z' at the end to 'Zaxis' to make it more readable and identify that we are referring to the orientation.


## Notes: 

I have decided to keep the "t" and "f" prefixes for time domain and frequency domain signals respectively. To remove any ambiguity, I have added a column to the feature list below clearly indicating what domain the signal belongs to.

Std stands for standard deviation.



Here is a description of each feature:
